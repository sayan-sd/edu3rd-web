        <p>
            Knowledge and consent are required for the collection, use or disclosure of Personal Information except where required or permitted by law. Providing us with your Personal Information is always your choice. However, your decision not to provide certain information may limit our ability to provide you with our products or services. We will not require you to consent to the collection, use, or disclosure of information as a condition to the supply of a product or service, except as required to be able to supply the product or service.
        </p>
        <h5>Limiting Use, Disclosure and Retention</h5>
        <p>
            Personal Information may only be used or disclosed for the purpose for which it was collected unless you have otherwise consented, or when it is required or permitted by law. Personal Information will only be retained for the period of time required to fulfill the purpose for which we collected it or as may be required by law. [If applicable, include a description of any parties with whom you may share Personal Information.]

    <div class="container" id="refund">
        <div class="refund-container" >
            <h2>Refund Policies</h2>
            <p>
                1. To reduce last-minute cancellations and the risk of "chargebacks" from customers, it is always a good idea to have your customers agree to your cancellation and refund policy. This should be attached to the customers' order for future reference. Occasion makes this easy for you and your customers.
            </p>
            <p>
                2. Due to limited seating, we request that you cancel at least 48 hours before a scheduled class. This gives us the opportunity to fill the class. You may cancel by phone or online here. If you have to cancel your class, we offer you a credit to your account if you cancel before 48 hours, but do not offer refunds. You may use these credits towards any future class. However, if you do not cancel before the 48 hours, you will lose the payment for the class. The owner has the only right to be flexible here.
            </p>
            <p>
                3. Cancellations made 7 days or more in advance of the event date, will receive a 100% refund. Cancellations made within 3 - 6 days will incur a 20% fee. Cancellations made within 48 hours of the event will incur a 30% fee.
            </p>
            <p>
                4. I understand that I am holding a spot so reservations for this event are nonrefundable. If I am unable to attend I understand that I can transfer to a friend.
            </p>
            <p>
                5. If your cancellation is at least 24 hours in advance of the class, you will receive a full refund. If your cancellation is less than 24 hours in advance, you will receive a gift certificate to attend a future class. We will do our best to accommodate your needs.
            </p>
            <p>
                6. You may cancel your class up to 24 hours before the class begins and request to receive a full refund. If cancellation is made the day of you will receive a credit to reschedule at a later date. Credit must be used within 90 days.
            </p>
            <p>
                7. You may request to cancel your ticket for a full refund, up to 72 hours before the date and time of the event. Cancellations between 25-72 hours before the event may transferred to a different date/time of the same class. Cancellation requests made within 24 hours of the class date/time may not receive a refund or a transfer. When you register for a class, you agree to these terms.
